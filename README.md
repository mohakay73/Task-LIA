# Task-LIA

It was alot of new things to learn while doing this project. Plus for sure i had some difficulties whcih are mostly technical.
I started by looking at some smart contracts i found on github and trying to understand the code. After i tried writing the code and using help from the codes i'm looking at plus chatgpt.
Most of the problems i faced is how to update versions and make the versions of the packages i'm using work together.
For example ganache and truflle.
I used different sources to try to find solutions. Chatgpt which didn't help alot, i googled a lot and i found a lot of answers on stackoverflow.
I think it was alot of improvements since i havn't been using solidity before. And after this task i have a little knowledge about how smart contracts are built and how they are implemented.
It was a lot of new things that we will be more clear after we go throught solidity next August.
